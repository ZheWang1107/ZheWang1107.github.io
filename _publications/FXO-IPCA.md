excerpt: 'We propose an IPCA latent factor model for pricing currency option returns. The model connects time-varying factor loadings with changing economic conditions on currency, option and the world economy. It consistently outperforms existing models in explaining currency straddle returns, with a more powerful pricing kernel for asset pricing. We also propose a new risk-based option momentum strategy that outperforms traditional return-based option momentum substantially, with a much greater Sharpe ratio. It is driven by risk and explains the traditional momentum, thereby providing a rational justification for the latter. Overall, our model offers novel economic insights and sets a new benchmark for understanding anomalies in the currency options market.'

We propose an IPCA latent factor model for pricing currency option returns. The model connects time-varying factor loadings with changing economic conditions on currency, option and the world economy. It consistently outperforms existing models in explaining currency straddle returns, with a more powerful pricing kernel for asset pricing. We also propose a new risk-based option momentum strategy that outperforms traditional return-based option momentum substantially, with a much greater Sharpe ratio.

Overall, our model offers novel economic insights and sets a new benchmark for understanding anomalies in the currency options market.<br/>
*Notes*: These four charts plot unconditional alpha and conditional alpha at the managed portfolio level, both annualized and scaled to 10\% volatility. Unconditional alpha is obtained from a time series regression, and conditional alpha is obtained by calculating the residuals period by period. Those that are significant at the 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% confidence levels are labeled red, orange, and yellow, respectively, and those that are not significant are labeled green. The sample period is from January 2006 to December 2022.<br/><img src='/images/IPCA.png'>
