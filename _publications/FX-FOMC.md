excerpt: 'This paper explores how currency risk premia vary on U.S. FOMC announcement days. We propose a new measure, the expected reduction in currency option implied variance (EVR), capturing exposure to monetary policy uncertainty. Currencies with higher EVR earn significantly higher returns on announcement days. A long-short strategy based on EVR yields substantial profits, even after adjusting for risk factors. Pre-announcement effects primarily drive these returns, with monetary policy shocks being the dominant factor, while central bank information shocks play a secondary role. The findings align with financial intermediaries' risk constraints, underscoring monetary policy uncertainty as a key driver of cross-sectional currency risk premia.'

*Notes*: These four charts plot unconditional alpha and conditional alpha at the managed portfolio level, both annualized and scaled to 10% volatility. Unconditional alpha is obtained from a time series regression, and conditional alpha is obtained by calculating the residuals period by period. Those that are significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% confidence levels are labeled red, orange, and yellow, respectively, and those that are not significant are labeled green. The sample period is from January 2006 to December 2022.
