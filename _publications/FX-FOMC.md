excerpt: "This paper explores how currency risk premia vary on U.S. FOMC announcement days. We propose a new measure, the expected reduction in currency option implied variance (EVR), capturing exposure to monetary policy uncertainty. Currencies with higher EVR earn significantly higher returns on announcement days. A long-short strategy based on EVR yields substantial profits, even after adjusting for risk factors. Pre-announcement effects primarily drive these returns, with monetary policy shocks being the dominant factor, while central bank information shocks play a secondary role. The findings align with financial intermediaries' risk constraints, underscoring monetary policy uncertainty as a key driver of cross-sectional currency risk premia."
