Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student at [the School of Economics, Zhejiang University](http://www.cec.zju.edu.cn/). I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Finance from the same institution in 2024, and then directly pursued my PhD at Zhejiang University.

My research interests lie in **empirical asset pricing** and **international finance**, including factor models for stocks, foreign exchange, and forex options. I am also exploring theoretical asset pricing, with a focus on integrating macroeconomic information closely with asset pricing. I welcome any feedback on theoretical studies or working papers!
